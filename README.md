# Introduction
- This project is a truck routing program to find an optimal path (not best)  in which to deliver all packages to their respective packages in under 140 miles.
- Nearest neighbor algorithm used in this project obtained an optimal path in just under 97 miles.
- Built using Python.

## About
- Utilize concepts such as: HashMaps, hashing, MVC, nearest neighbor algorithm.
- Certain trucks have constraints according to certain package instructions which are accounted for in the code.
- Implements a custom CLI interface for users to query the total mileage for the route as well as the status for trucks given a time.
